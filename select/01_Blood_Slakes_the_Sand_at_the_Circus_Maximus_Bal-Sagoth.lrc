[00:54.47] Hearken! The Ninth Legion has been put to the sword
[00:56.67] Onwards to Camulodunum
[00:59.22] Redden the earth with Roman blood
[01:15.72] 
[03:58.38] Fight, barbarian outlander!
[04:01.75] Please us, and mayhap Mars will smile on thee this day!
[04:06.81] Bah! I do not hail to your Roman gods, and you are not my emperor!
[04:11.64] By Cernunnos, the blood of my enemies shall stain
[04:14.31] The sand of this cursed arena red this day!
