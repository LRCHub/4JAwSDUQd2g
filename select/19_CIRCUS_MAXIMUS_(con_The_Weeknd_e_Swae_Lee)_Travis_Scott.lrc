[00:00.14] Unreal, what is this?
[00:02.72] God done gave me strength
[00:06.17] Are these the front row seats you wanted?
[00:10.18] We'll have our final moment
[00:23.68] 
[00:26.90] A walk-in attraction
[00:29.04] A walking distraction
[00:30.60] I'm naturally black and
[00:32.47] Unnaturally breathing
[00:34.56] Like a waist that is snatching
[00:35.77] Welcome to my world, where it's packed in
[00:38.17] At the top of the tavern
[00:40.03] How I see when this happenin'
[00:54.53] 
[00:41.90] All the real have been dabbed in
[00:43.63] All the, all the bumps and the grabbin'
[00:45.70] Ain't no cops here harassing
[00:47.42] All the looks and the laughin'
[00:49.53] And outside, it got traffic
[00:51.34] 'Cause inside, we wreak havoc
[01:05.84] 
[00:53.54] Yeah, I know when this, yeah, I know when this drastic
[00:55.91] Where it's goin'
[00:57.26] When I back up emotions
[00:59.08] All this here, I'm controllin'
[01:00.66] When I'm back in the
[01:02.39] When I'm back in the streets, on my side, I'm patrollin'
[01:04.97] When I'm back in the, when I'm back in the (ah)

[01:11.58] But do you care if I was alive? (Whenever I'm back in the) (ah)
[01:15.64] Or do you want to be famous? (Woo, yeah)
[01:35.64] 
[01:21.92] I took the top off
[01:22.92] Like she took that lil' blouse off
[01:25.28] Too hard to go drop off
[01:27.37] You know that boy not soft
[01:28.84] I never would travel
[01:30.96] So I need me a time vault
[01:32.65] I been up in Cabo
[01:34.54] With my Bailey Osanto
[01:45.04] 
[01:36.40] In this world, look around, yo
[01:38.76] It's just mano y mano
[01:40.71] I might still eat McDonald's
[01:42.47] But don't think I'm a Ronald
[01:44.13] I went back to my land
[01:45.98] Move like Moses, walking over seas
[01:47.71] In my state because the country
[01:49.64] Every part of it is part of me
[02:04.64] 
[01:51.72] Tell your parliament, "Pardon me" (woo)
[01:53.71] Off the saké, turned to Socrates (woo)
[01:55.56] Heavy moments on the ground
[01:57.26] Feel it shapin' in the sound

[02:01.81] And you know that we down

[02:09.53] So much that I'm flyin'
