Unreal, what is this?
God done gave me strength
Are these the front row seats you wanted?
We'll have our final moment

A walk-in attraction
A walking distraction
I'm naturally black and
I'm naturally breathing
Like a waist that is snatching
Welcome to my world, where it's packed in
At the top of the tavern
How I see when this happenin'
All the real have been dabbed in
All the, all the bumps and the grabbin'
Ain't no cops here harassing
All the looks and the laughin'
And outside, it got traffic
'Cause inside, we wreak havoc
Yeah, I know when this, yeah, I know when this drastic
Where it's goin'
When I back up emotions
All this here, I'm controllin'
When I'm back in the
When I'm back in the streets, on my side, I'm patrollin'
When I'm back in the, when I'm back in the (Ah)

I know our love is forsaken (Woo)
But do you care if I was alive? (Whenever I'm back in the)
Or do you want to be famous? (Woo, yeah)

I took the top off
Like she took that lil' blouse off
Too hard to go drop off
You know that boy not soft
I never would travel
So I need me a time vault
I been up in Cabo
With my Bailey Osanto
In this world, look around, yo
It's just mano y mano
I might still eat McDonald's
But don't think I'm a Ronald
I went back to my land
Move like Moses, walking over seas
In my state because the country
Every part of it is part of me
Tell your parliament, "Pardon me" (Woo)
Off the saké, turned to Socrates (Woo)
Heavy moments on the ground
Feel it shapin' in the sound
'Cause we ri—, 'cause we right in yo' house
And you know that we down
If yo' ass don't know nothin'
Gotta know that it's time
I'm excited, it's jumpin'
So much that I'm flyin'
Put you right in the function
Took you right off a vine
Got this shit in a bind
We got it, we got it now
(Agh, woo)
Whenever I'm ducking it
(Agh, woo)

I'm waiting on a let go
I'm waiting on a let go
I know myself, I know exactly how to make you special
Go, go, let your fame
I'm waiting in an echo
I'm waiting in an echo
'Cause you keep calling out, I thought I told you that we do not
Sorry, I didn't let you out, out
Out-out, la-la
(Out, out)
(Out-out, la-la)
